data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Course - What are the prerequisites for this course?,GitHub - DataTalksClub data-engineering-zoomcamp#prerequisites
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Course - Can I still join the course after the start date?,"Yes, even if you don't register, you're still eligible to submit the homeworks.
Be aware, however, that there will be deadlines for turning in the final projects. So don't leave everything for the last minute."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Course - I have registered for the Data Engineering Bootcamp. When can I expect to receive the confirmation email?,You don't need it. You're accepted. You can also just start learning and submitting homework without registering. It is not checked against any registered list. Registration is just to gauge interest before the start date.
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Course - What can I do before the course starts?,"You can start by installing and setting up all the dependencies and requirements:
Google cloud account
Google Cloud SDK
Python 3 (installed with Anaconda)
Terraform
Git
Look over the prerequisites and syllabus to see if you are comfortable with these subjects."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Course - how many Zoomcamps in a year?,"There are 3 Zoom Camps in a year, as of 2024. However, they are for separate courses:
Data-Engineering (Jan - Apr)
MLOps (May - Aug)
Machine Learning (Sep - Jan)
There's only one Data-Engineering Zoomcamp “live” cohort per year, for the certification. Same as for the other Zoomcamps.
They follow pretty much the same schedule for each cohort per zoomcamp. For Data-Engineering it is (generally) from Jan-Apr of the year. If you’re not interested in the Certificate, you can take any zoom camps at any time, at your own pace, out of sync with any “live” cohort."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Course - Is the current cohort going to be different from the previous cohort?,"Yes. For the 2024 edition we are using Mage AI instead of Prefect and re-recorded the terraform videos, For 2023, we used Prefect instead of Airflow.."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Course - Can I follow the course after it finishes?,"Yes, we will keep all the materials after the course finishes, so you can follow the course at your own pace after it finishes.
You can also continue looking at the homeworks and continue preparing for the next cohort. I guess you can also start working on your final capstone project."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Course - Can I get support if I take the course in the self-paced mode?,"Yes, the slack channel remains open and you can ask questions there. But always sDocker containers exit code w search the channel first and second, check the FAQ (this document), most likely all your questions are already answered here.
You can also tag the bot @ZoomcampQABot to help you conduct the search, but don’t rely on its answers 100%, it is pretty good though."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Course - Which playlist on YouTube should I refer to?,"All the main videos are stored in the Main “DATA ENGINEERING” playlist (no year specified). The Github repository has also been updated to show each video with a thumbnail, that would bring you directly to the same playlist below.
Below is the MAIN PLAYLIST’. And then you refer to the year specific playlist for additional videos for that year like for office hours videos etc. Also find this playlist pinned to the slack channel.

data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Course - ​​How many hours per week am I expected to spend on this  course?,"It depends on your background and previous experience with modules. It is expected to require about 5 - 15 hours per week. [source1] [source2]
You can also calculate it yourself using this data and then update this answer."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Certificate - Can I follow the course in a self-paced mode and get a certificate?,"No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a “live” cohort. We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review capstone(s) after submitting a project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Office Hours - What is the video/zoom link to the stream for the “Office Hour” or workshop sessions?,"The zoom link is only published to instructors/presenters/TAs.
Students participate via Youtube Live and submit questions to Slido (link would be pinned in the chat when Alexey goes Live). The video URL should be posted in the announcements channel on Telegram & Slack before it begins. Also, you will see it live on the DataTalksClub YouTube Channel.
Don’t post your questions in chat as it would be off-screen before the instructors/moderators have a chance to answer it if the room is very active."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,"Office Hours - I can’t attend the “Office hours” / workshop, will it be recorded?",Yes! Every “Office Hours” will be recorded and available a few minutes after the live session is over; so you can view (or rewatch) whenever you want.
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Homework - What are homework and project deadlines?,"You can find the latest and up-to-date deadlines here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQACMLuutV5rvXg5qICuJGL-yZqIV0FBD84CxPdC5eZHf8TfzB-CJT_3Mo7U7oGVTXmSihPgQxuuoku/pubhtml
Also, take note of Announcements from @Au-Tomator for any extensions or other news. Or, the form may also show the updated deadline, if Instructor(s) has updated it."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Homework - Are late submissions of homework allowed?,"No, late submissions are not allowed. But if the form is still not closed and it’s after the due date, you can still submit the homework. confirm your submission by the date-timestamp on the Course page.y
Older news:[source1] [source2]"
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Homework - What is the homework URL in the homework link?,"Answer: In short, it’s your repository on github, gitlab, bitbucket, etc
In long, your repository or any other location you have your code where a reasonable person would look at it and think yes, you went through the week and exercises."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Homework and Leaderboard - what is the system for points in the course management platform?,"After you submit your homework it will be graded based on the amount of questions in a particular homework. You can see how many points you have right on the page of the homework up top. Additionally in the leaderboard you will find the sum of all points you’ve earned - points for Homeworks, FAQs and Learning in Public. If homework is clear, others work as follows: if you submit something to FAQ, you get one point, for each learning in a public link you get one point.

data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Environment - Is Python 3.9 still the recommended version to use in 2024?,"Yes, for simplicity (of troubleshooting against the recorded videos) and stability. [source]
But Python 3.10 and 3.11 should work fine."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,"Environment - Should I use my local machine, GCP, or GitHub Codespaces for my environment?","You can set it up on your laptop or PC if you prefer to work locally from your laptop or PC.
You might face some challenges, especially for Windows users. If you face cnd2
If you prefer to work on the local machine, you may start with the week 1 Introduction to Docker and follow through.
However, if you prefer to set up a virtual machine, you may start with these first:
Using GitHub Codespaces
Setting up the environment on a cloudV Mcodespace
I decided to work on a virtual machine because I have different laptops & PCs for my home & office, so I can work on this boot camp virtually anywhere."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Environment - Is GitHub codespaces an alternative to using cli/git bash to ingest the data and create a docker file?,"GitHub Codespaces offers you computing Linux resources with many pre-installed tools (Docker, Docker Compose, Python).
You can also open any GitHub repository in a GitHub Codespace."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Environment - Do we really have to use GitHub codespaces? I already have PostgreSQL & Docker installed.,"It's up to you which platform and environment you use for the course.
Github codespaces or GCP VM are just possible options, but you can do the entire course from your laptop."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Environment - Do I need both GitHub Codespaces and GCP?,"Choose the approach that aligns the most with your idea for the end project
One of those should suffice. However, BigQuery, which is part of GCP, will be used, so learning that is probably a better option. Or you can set up a local environment for most of this course."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,This happens when attempting to connect to a GCP VM using VSCode on a Windows machine. Changing registry value in registry editor,"1. To open Run command window, you can either:
(1-1) Use the shortcut keys: 'Windows + R', or
(1-2) Right Click ""Start"", and click ""Run"" to open.
2. Registry Values Located in Registry Editor, to open it: Type 'regedit' in the Run command window, and then press Enter.' 3. Now you can change the registry values ""Autorun"" in ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor"" from ""if exists"" to a blank.
Alternatively, You can simplify the solution by deleting the fingerprint saved within the known_hosts file. In Windows, this file is placed at  C:\Users\<your_user_name>\.ssh\known_host"
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Environment - Why are we using GCP and not other cloud providers?,"For uniformity at least, but you’re not restricted to GCP, you can use other cloud platforms like AWS if you’re comfortable with other cloud platforms, since you get every service that’s been provided by GCP in Azure and AWS or others..
Because everyone has a google account, GCP has a free trial period and gives $300 in credits  to new users. Also, we are working with BigQuery, which is a part of GCP.
Note that to sign up for a free GCP account, you must have a valid credit card."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Should I pay for cloud services?,"No, if you use GCP and take advantage of their free trial."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Environment - The GCP and other cloud providers are unavailable in some countries. Is it possible to provide a guide to installing a home lab?,"You can do most of the course without a cloud. Almost everything we use (excluding BigQuery) can be run locally. We won’t be able to provide guidelines for some things, but most of the materials are runnable without GCP.
For everything in the course, there’s a local alternative. You could even do the whole course locally."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Environment - I want to use AWS. May I do that?,"Yes, you can. Just remember to adapt all the information on the videos to AWS. Besides, the final capstone will be evaluated based on the task: Create a data pipeline! Develop a visualisation!
The problem would be when you need help. You’d need to rely on  fellow coursemates who also use AWS (or have experience using it before), which might be in smaller numbers than those learning the course with GCP.
Also see Is it possible to use x tool instead of the one tool you use?"
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Besides the “Office Hour” which are the live zoom calls?,We will probably have some calls during the Capstone period to clear some questions but it will be announced in advance if that happens.
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Are we still using the NYC Trip data for January 2021? Or are we using the 2022 data?,"We will use the same data, as the project will essentially remain the same as last year’s. The data is available here"
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Is the 2022 repo deleted?,"No, but we moved the 2022 stuff here"
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Can I use Airflow instead for my final project?,"Yes, you can use any tool you want for your project."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Is it possible to use tool “X” instead of the one tool you use in the course?,"Yes, this applies if you want to use Airflow or Prefect instead of Mage, AWS or Snowflake instead of GCP products or Tableau instead of Metabase or Google data studio.
The course covers 2 alternative data stacks, one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.
Should you consider it instead of the one tool you use? That we can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack, also you would need to explain the different choices of tool for the peer review of your capstone project."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,How can we contribute to the course?,"Star the repo! Share it with friends if you find it useful ❣️
Create a PR if you see you can improve the text or the structure of the repository."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Environment - Is the course [Windows/mac/Linux/...] friendly?,Yes! Linux is ideal but technically it should not matter. Students last year used all 3 OSes successfully
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Environment - Roadblock for Windows users in modules with *.sh (shell scripts).,"Have no idea how past cohorts got past this as I haven't read old slack messages, and no FAQ entries that I can find.
Later modules (module-05 & RisingWave workshop) use shell scripts in *.sh files and most Windows users not using WSL would hit a wall and cannot continue, even in git bash or MINGW64. This is why WSL environment setup is recommended from the start."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Any books or additional resources you recommend?,Yes to both! check out this document: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/awesome-data-engineering.md
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Project - What is Project Attemp #1 and Project Attempt #2 exactly?,"You will have two attempts for a project. If the first project deadline is over and you’re late or you submit the project and fail the first attempt, you have another chance to submit the project with the second attempt."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,How to troubleshoot issues,"The first step is to try to solve the issue on your own. Get used to solving problems and reading documentation. This will be a real life skill you need when employed. [ctrl+f] is your friend, use it! It is a universal shortcut and works in all apps/browsers.
What does the error say? There will often be a description of the error or instructions on what is needed or even how to fix it. I have even seen a link to the solution. Does it reference a specific line of your code?
Restart app or server/pc.
Google it, use ChatGPT, Bing AI etc.
It is going to be rare that you are the first to have the problem, someone out there has posted the fly issue and likely the solution.
Search using: <technology> <problem statement>. Example: pgcli error column c.relhasoids does not exist.
There are often different solutions for the same problem due to variation in environments.
Check the tech’s documentation. Use its search if available or use the browsers search function.
Try uninstall (this may remove the bad actor) and reinstall of application or reimplementation of action. Remember to restart the server/pc for reinstalls.
Sometimes reinstalling fails to resolve the issue but works if you uninstall first.
Post your question to Stackoverflow. Read the Stackoverflow guide on posting good questions.
https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask
This will be your real life. Ask an expert in the future (in addition to coworkers).
Ask in Slack
Before asking a question,
Check Pins (where the shortcut to the repo and this FAQ is located)
Use the slack app’s search function
Use the bot @ZoomcampQABot to do the search for you
check the FAQ (this document), use search [ctrl+f]
When asking a question, include as much information as possible:
What are you coding on? What OS?
What command did you run, which video did you follow? Etc etc
What error did you get? Does it have a line number to the “offending” code and have you check it for typos?
What have you tried that did not work? This answer is crucial as without it, helpers would ask you to do the suggestions in the error log first. Or just read this FAQ document.
DO NOT use screenshots, especially don’t take pictures from a phone.
DO NOT tag instructors, it may discourage others from helping you. Copy and paste errors; if it’s long, just post it in a reply to your thread.
Use ``` for formatting your code.
Use the same thread for the conversation (that means reply to your own thread).
DO NOT create multiple posts to discuss the issue.
learYou may create a new post if the issue reemerges down the road. Describe what has changed in the environment.
Provide additional information in the same thread of the steps you have taken for resolution.
Take a break and come back later. You will be amazed at how often you figure out the solution after letting your brain rest. Get some fresh air, workout, play a video game, watch a tv show, whatever allows your brain to not think about it for a little while or even until the next day.
Remember technology issues in real life sometimes take days or even weeks to resolve.
If somebody helped you with your problem and it's not in the FAQ, please add it there. It will help other students."
data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,How to ask questions,"When the troubleshooting guide above does not help resolve it and you need another pair of eyeballs to spot mistakes. When asking a question, include as much information as possible:

data-engineering-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,How do I use Git / GitHub for this course?,"After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub
Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).
You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository
Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).

data-engineering-zoomcamp,Module 1: Docker and Terraform,"Taxi Data - How to handle taxi data files, now that the files are available as *.csv.gz?","In this video, we store the data file as “output.csv”. The data file won’t store correctly if the file extension is csv.gz instead of csv. One alternative is to replace csv_name = “output.cs -v” with the file name given at the end of the URL. Notice that the URL for the yellow taxi data is: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz where the highlighted part is the name of the file. We can parse this file name from the URL and use it as csv_name. That is, we can replace csv_name = “output.csv” with
csv_name = url.split(“/”)[-1] . Then when we use csv_name to using pd.read_csv, there won’t be an issue even though the file name really has the extension csv.gz instead of csv since the pandas read_csv function can read csv.gz files directly."

On Ubuntu, run:
$ sudo apt-get install wget
On MacOS, the easiest way to install wget is to use Brew:
$ brew install wget
On Windows, the easiest way to install wget is to use Chocolatey:
$ choco install wget
Or you can download a binary (https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm) and put it to any location in your PATH (e.g. C:/tools/)
Also, you can following this step to install Wget on MS Windows
* Download the latest wget binary for windows from [eternallybored] (https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/) (they are available as a zip with documentation, or just an exe)
* If you downloaded the zip, extract all (if windows built in zip utility gives an error, use [7-zip] (https://7-zip.org/)).
* Rename the file `wget64.exe` to `wget.exe` if necessary.
* Move wget.exe to your `Git\mingw64\bin\`.
Alternatively, you can use a Python wget library, but instead of simply using “wget” you’ll need to use
python -m wget
You need to install it with pip first:
pip install wget
Alternatively, you can just paste the file URL into your web browser and download the file normally that way. You’ll want to move the resulting file into your working directory.

Hyper-V or WSL2 as its backend. However, a few constraints might apply
Windows 10 Pro / 11 Pro Users: 
In order to use Hyper-V as its back-end, you MUST have it enabled first, which you can do by following the tutorial: Enable Hyper-V Option on Windows 10 / 11
Windows 10 Home / 11 Home Users: 
On the other hand, Users of the 'Home' version do NOT have the option Hyper-V option enabled, which means, you can only get Docker up and running using the WSL2 credentials(Windows Subsystem for Linux). Url
You can find the detailed instructions to do so here: rt ghttps://pureinfotech.com/install-wsl-windows-11/
In case, you run into another issue while trying to install WSL2 (WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x800701bc), Make sure you update the WSL2 Linux Kernel, following the guidelines here:

data-engineering-zoomcamp,Module 1: Docker and Terraform,Docker - docker pull dbpage,"Whenever a `docker pull is performed (either manually or by `docker-compose up`), it attempts to fetch the given image name (pgadmin4, for the example above) from a repository (dbpage).
IF the repository is public, the fetch and download happens without any issue whatsoever.
For instance:
docker pull postgres:13
docker pull dpage/pgadmin4
BE ADVISED:

The Docker Images we'll be using throughout the Data Engineering Zoomcamp are all public (except when or if explicitly said otherwise by the instructors or co-instructors).

Meaning: you are NOT required to perform a docker login to fetch them. 

So if you get the message above saying ""docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied. That is most likely due to a typo in your image name:

For instance:
$ docker pull dbpage/pgadmin4
Will throw that exception telling you ""repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'
Error response from daemon: pull access denied for dbpage/pgadmin4, repository does not exist or 
may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied
But that actually happened because the actual image is dpage/pgadmin4 and NOT dbpage/pgadmin4
How to fix it:
$ docker pull dpage/pgadmin4
EXTRA NOTES:
In the real world, occasionally, when you're working for a company or closed organisation, the Docker image you're trying to fetch might be under a private repo that your DockerHub Username was granted access to.
For which cases, you must first execute:
$ docker login
Fill in the details of your username and password.
And only then perform the `docker pull` against that private repository
Why am I encountering a ""permission denied"" error when creating a PostgreSQL Docker container for the New York Taxi Database with a mounted volume on macOS M1?
Issue Description:
When attempting to run a Docker command similar to the one below:
docker run -it \
-e POSTGRES_USER=""root"" \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=""root"" \
-e POSTGRES_DB=""ny_taxi"" \
-v $(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
-p 5432:5432 \mount
postgres:13
You encounter the error message:
docker: Error response from daemon: error while creating mount source path '/path/to/ny_taxi_postgres_data': chown /path/to/ny_taxi_postgres_data: permission denied.
Solution:
1- Stop Rancher Desktop:
If you are using Rancher Desktop and face this issue, stop Rancher Desktop to resolve compatibility problems.
2- Install Docker Desktop:
Install Docker Desktop, ensuring that it is properly configured and has the required permissions.
2-Retry Docker Command:

error: could not change permissions of directory ""/var/lib/postgresql/data"": Operation not permitted  volume
One way to solve this issue is to create a local docker volume and map it to postgres data directory /var/lib/postgresql/data
The input dtc_postgres_volume_local must match in both commands below
$ docker volume create --name dtc_postgres_volume_local -d local
$ docker run -it\
-e POSTGRES_USER=""root"" \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=""root"" \
-e POSTGRES_DB=""ny_taxi"" \

To verify the above command works in (WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04, verified 2024-Jan), go to the Docker Desktop app and look under Volumes - dtc_postgres_volume_local would be listed there. The folder ny_taxi_postgres_data would however be empty, since we used an alternative config.
An alternate error could be:

move your data to some folder without spaces. E.g. if your code is in “C:/Users/Alexey Grigorev/git/…”, move it to “C:/git/…”
Try replacing the “-v” part with one of the following options:

-v //c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

-v “/c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data""
-v ""//c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data""
-v ""c:\some\path\ny_taxi_postgres_data"":/var/lib/postgresql/data
Note:  (Window) if it automatically creates a folder called “ny_taxi_postgres_data;C” suggests you have problems with volume mapping, try deleting both folders and replacing “-v” part with other options. For me “//c/” works instead of “/c/”. And it will work by automatically creating a correct folder called “ny_taxi_postgres_data”.
A possible solution to this error would be to use /”$(pwd)”/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data (with quotes’ position varying as in the above list).
Yes for windows use the command it works perfectly fine
-v /”$(pwd)”/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
Important: note how the quotes are placed.
If none of these options work, you can use a volume name instead of the path:
-v ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
For Mac: You can wrap $(pwd) with quotes like the highlighted.
docker run -it \

Since at this point we only need the files Dockerfile and ingest_data.py, to fix this error one can run the docker build command on a different directory (having only these two files).

data-engineering-zoomcamp,Module 1: Docker and Terraform,WSL Docker directory permissions error,"Error:  initdb: error: could not change permissions of directory
Issue: WSL and Windows do not manage permissions in the same way causing conflict if using the Windows file system rather than the WSL file system.
Solution: Use Docker volumes.
Why: Volume is used for storage of persistent data and not for use of transferring files. A local volume is unnecessary.
Benefit: This resolves permission issues and allows for better management of volumes.
NOTE: the ‘user:’ is not necessary if using docker volumes, but is if using local drive.

observations: Below in bold do not forget the folder that was created ny_taxi_postgres_data
This happens if you have a local Postgres installation in your computer. To mitigate this, use a different port, like 5431, when creating the docker container, as in: -p 5431: 5432
Then, we need to use this port when connecting to pgcli, as shown below:
pgcli -h localhost -p 5431 -u root -d ny_taxi
This will connect you to your postgres docker container, which is mapped to your host’s 5431 port (though you might choose any port of your liking as long as it is not occupied).
For a more visual and detailed explanation, feel free to check the video 1.4.2 - Port Mapping and Networks in Docker
If you want to debug: the following can help (on a MacOS)
To find out if something is blocking your port (on a MacOS):
You can use the lsof command to find out which application is using a specific port on your local machine. `lsof -i :5432`wi
Or list the running postgres services on your local machine with launchctl
To unload the running service on your local machine (on a MacOS):
unload the launch agent for the PostgreSQL service, which will stop the service and free up the port  
`launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist`
this one to start it again
`launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist`
Changing port from 5432:5432 to 5431:5432 helped me to avoid this error."

Make sure you install pgcli without sudo.
The recommended approach is to use conda/anaconda to make sure your system python is not affected.
If conda install gets stuck at ""Solving environment"" try these alternatives: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63734508/stuck-at-solving-environment-on-anaconda"
data-engineering-zoomcamp,Module 1: Docker and Terraform,PGCLI - no pq wrapper available.,"ImportError: no pq wrapper available.
Attempts made:
- couldn't import \dt
opg 'c' implementation: No module named 'psycopg_c'
- couldn't import psycopg 'binary' implementation: No module named 'psycopg_binary'
- couldn't import psycopg 'python' implementation: libpq library not found
Solution:
First, make sure your Python is set to 3.9, at least.
And the reason for that is we have had cases of 'psycopg2-binary' failing to install because of an old version of Python (3.7.3). 

0. You can check your current python version with: 
$ python -V(the V must be capital)
1. Based on the previous output, if you've got a 3.9, skip to Step #2
   Otherwispye better off with a new environment with 3.9
$ conda create –name de-zoomcamp python=3.9
$ conda activate de-zoomcamp
2. Next, you should be able to install the lib for postgres like this:
```
$ e
$ pip install psycopg2_binary
```
3. Finally, make sure you're also installing pgcli, but use conda for that:
```
$ pgcli -h localhost -U root -d ny_taxisudo
```
There, you should be good to go now!
Another solution:
Run this
pip install ""psycopg[binary,pool]"""

The error above was faced continually despite inputting the correct password
Solution
Option 1: Stop the PostgreSQL service on Windows
Option 2 (using WSL): Completely uninstall Protgres 12 from Windows and install postgresql-client on WSL (sudo apt install postgresql-client-common postgresql-client libpq-dev)
Option 3: Change the port of the docker container
NEW SOLUTION: 27/01/2024
PGCLI -connection failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user ""root""
If you’ve got the error above, it’s probably because you were just like me, closed the connection to the Postgres:13 image in the previous step of the tutorial, which is

-v d:/git/data-engineering-zoomcamp/week_1/docker_sql/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \

Get the location: pip list -v
Copy C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\site-packages
3. Replace site-packages with Scripts: C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\Scripts
It can also be that you have Python installed elsewhere.
For me it was under c:\python310\lib\site-packages
So I had to add c:\python310\lib\Scripts to PATH, as shown below.
Put the above path in ""Path"" (or ""PATH"") in System Variables

However, if you try to run the whole script in the Jupyter notebook for a second time from top to bottom, you will be missing the first chunk of 100000 records. This is because there is a call to the iterator before the while loop that puts the data in the table. The while loop therefore starts by ingesting the second chunk, not the first.
✅Solution: remove the cell “df=next(df_iter)” that appears higher up in the notebook than the while loop. The first time w(df_iter) is called should be within the while loop.

One way of doing that is to use conda: ‘If you are not already using it
Download the Anaconda Navigator
Make sure to check the box (add conda to the path when installing navigator: although not recommended do it anyway)
You might also need to install git bash if you are not already using it(or you might need to uninstall it to reinstall it properly)
Make sure to check the following boxes while you install Gitbash
Add a GitBash to Windows Terminal
Use Git and optional Unix tools from the command prompt
Now open up git bash and type conda init bash This should modify your bash profile
Additionally, you might want to use Gitbash as your default terminal.

Adding it to the PATH is different for each operation system.
For Linux and MacOS:
Open a terminal.
Find the path to your Anaconda installation. This is typically `~/anaconda3` or `~/opt/anaconda3`.
Add Anaconda to your PATH with the command: `export PATH=""/path/to/anaconda3/bin:$PATH""`.
To make this change permanent, add the command to your `.bashrc` (Linux) or `.bash_profile` (MacOS) file.
On Windows, python and pip are in different locations (python is in the anaconda root, and pip is in Scripts). With GitBash:
Locate your Anaconda installation. The default path is usually `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Anaconda3`.
Determine the correct path format for Git Bash. Paths in Git Bash follow the Unix-style, so convert the Windows path to a Unix-style path. For example, `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Anaconda3` becomes `/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3`.
Add Anaconda to your PATH with the command: `export PATH=""/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3/:/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3/Scripts/$PATH""`.
To make this change permanent, add the command to your `.bashrc` file in your home directory.
Refresh your environment with the command: `source ~/.bashrc`.
For Windows (without Git Bash):
Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.
Click on 'Advanced system settings'.
In the System Properties window, click on 'Environment Variables'.
In the Environment Variables window, select the 'Path' variable in the 'System variables' section and click 'Edit'.
In the Edit Environment Variable window, click 'New' and add the path to your Anaconda installation (typically `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Anaconda3` and C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Anaconda3\Scripts`).
Click 'OK' in all windows to apply the changes.
After adding Anaconda to the PATH, you should be able to use `pip` from the command line. Remember to restart your terminal (or command prompt in Windows) to apply these changes."

This error might happen when you are using a VM inside GCS. To use the Google APIs from a GCP virtual machine you need to add the cloud platform scope (""https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"") to your VM when it is created.
Since ours is already created you can just stop it and change the permissions. You can do it in the console, just go to ""EDIT"", g99o all the way down until you find ""Cloud API access scopes"". There you can ""Allow full access to all Cloud APIs"". I did this and all went smoothly generating all the resources needed. Hope it helps if you encounter this same error.

Deploying MAGE to GCP  with Terraform via the VM (2.2.7)
FYI - It can take up to 20 minutes to deploy the MAGE Terraform files if you are using a GCP Virtual Machine. It is normal, so don’t interrupt the process or think it’s taking too long. If you have, make sure you run a terraform destroy before trying again as you will have likely partially created resources which will cause errors next time you run `terraform apply`.
`terraform destroy` may not completely delete partial resources - go to Google Cloud Console and use the search bar at the top to search for the ‘app.name’ you declared in your variables.tf file; this will list all resources with that name - make sure you delete them all before running `terraform apply` again.
Why are my GCP free credits going so fast? MAGE .tf files - Terraform Destroy not destroying all Resources
I checked my GCP billing last night & the MAGE Terraform IaC didn't destroy a GCP Resource called Filestore as ‘mage-data-prep- it has been costing £5.01 of my free credits each day  I now have £151 left - Alexey has assured me that This amount WILL BE SUFFICIENT funds to finish the course. Note to anyone who had issues deploying the MAGE terraform code: check your billing account to see what you're being charged for (main menu - billing) (even if it's your free credits) and run a search for 'mage-data-prep' in the top bar just to be sure that your resources have been destroyed - if any come up delete them."

When dealing for example with the FHV Datasets from 2019, however (see image below), one can see that the files for '2019-05', and 2019-06, have the columns ""PUlocationID"" and ""DOlocationID"" as Integers, while for the period of '2019-01' through '2019-04', the same column is defined as FLOAT.
So while importing these files as parquet to BigQuery, the first one will be used to define the schema of the table, while all files following that will be used to append data on the existing table. Which means, they must all follow the very same schema of the file that created the table.

If you’re using Mage, in the last Data Exporter that writes to Google Cloud Storage, provide PyArrow with explicit schema to generate the Parquet file with the correct logical type for the datetime columns, otherwise they won't be converted to timestamp when loaded by BigQuery later on.
schema = pa.schema([
('vendor_id', pa.int64()),
('lpep_pickup_datetime', pa.timestamp('ns')),
('lpep_dropoff_datetime', pa.timestamp('ns')),

Solution:
Fix the data type issue in data pipeline
Before injecting data into GCS, use astype and Int64 (which is different from int64 and accept both missing value and integer exist in the column) to cast the columns.
Something like:
df[""PUlocationID""] = df.PUlocationID.astype(""Int64"")
df[""DOlocationID""] = df.DOlocationID.astype(""Int64"")

pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Casting from timestamp[us] to timestamp[ns] would result in out of bounds
Cause:
there is one errant data record where the dropOff_datetime was set to year 3019 instead of 2019.
pandas uses “timestamp[ns]” (as noted above), and int64 only allows a ~580 year range, centered on 2000. See `pd.Timestamp.max` and `pd.Timestamp.min`
This becomes out of bounds when pandas tries to read it because 3019 > 2300 (approx value of pd.Timestamp.Max
Fix:
Use pyarrow to read it:
import pyarrow.parquet as pq df = pq.read_table('fhv_tripdata_2019-02.parquet').to_pandas(safe=False)
However this results in weird timestamps for the offending record
Read the datetime columns separately using pq.read_table

table = pq.read_table(‘taxi.parquet’)
datetimes = [‘list of datetime column names’]
df_dts = pd.DataFrame()
for col in datetimes:
df_dts[col] = pd.to_datetime(table .column(col), errors='coerce')

The `errors=’coerce’` parameter will convert the out of bounds timestamps into either the max or the min
Use parquet.compute.filter to remove the offending rows

import pyarrow.compute as pc

df = table.filter(
pc.less_equal(table[""dropOff_datetime""], pa.scalar(pd.Timestamp.max))

Reason: Parquet files have their own schema. Some parquet files for green data have records with decimals in ehail_fee column.
There are some possible fixes:
Drop ehail_feel column since it is not really used. For instance when creating a partitioned table from the external table in BigQuery
SELECT * EXCEPT (ehail_fee) FROM…
Modify stg_green_tripdata.sql model using this line cast(0 as numeric) as ehail_fee.
Modify Airflow dag to make the conversion and avoid the error.
pv.read_csv(src_file, convert_options=pv.ConvertOptions(column_types = {'ehail_fee': 'float64'}))
Same type of ERROR - parquet files with different data types - Fix it with pandas
Here is another possibility that could be interesting:
You can specify the dtypes when importing the file from csv to a dataframe with pandas
pd.from_csv(..., dtype=type_dict)
One obstacle is that the regular int64 pandas use (I think this is from the numpy library) does not accept null values (NaN, not a number). But you can use the pandas Int64 instead, notice capital ‘I’. The type_dict is a python dictionary mapping the column names to the dtypes.

Likely, your source data will be in your region, but the write location will be a multi-regional location (US in this example). Delete these datasets, and recreate them with your specified region and the correct naming format.
Alternatively, instead of removing datasets, you can specify the single-region location you are using. E.g. instead of ‘location: US’, specify the region, so ‘location: US-east1’. See this Github comment for more detail. Additionally please see this post of Sandy
In DBT cloud you can actually specify the location using the following steps:
GPo to your profile page (top right drop-down --> profile)
Then go to under Credentials --> Analytics (you may have customised this name)
Click on Bigquery >
Hit Edit

One way to solve this problem is to specify/ cast data type Int64 during the data transformation stage.
However, you may be lazy to type all the int columns. If that is the case, you can simply use convert_dtypes to infer the data type

data-engineering-zoomcamp,Module 4: analytics engineering with dbt,Inconsistent number of rows when re-running fact_trips model,"This is due to the way the deduplication is done in the two staging files.
Solution: add order by in the partition by part of both staging files. Keep adding columns to order by until the number of rows in the fact_trips table is consistent when re-running the fact_trips model.
Explanation (a bit convoluted, feel free to clarify, correct etc.)
We partition by vendor id and pickup_datetime and choose the first row (rn=1) from all these partitions. These partitions are not ordered, so every time we run this, the first row might be a different one. Since the first row is different between runs, it might or might not contain an unknown borough. Then, in the fact_trips model we will discard a different number of rows when we discard all values with an unknown borough."

data-engineering-zoomcamp,Module 4: analytics engineering with dbt,How to set environment variable easily for any credentials,"If you have to securely put your credentials for a project and, probably, push it to a git repository then the best option is to use an environment variable
For example for web_to_gcs.py or git_csv_to_gcs.py we have to set these variables:
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
GCP_GCS_BUCKET
The easises option to do it  is to use .env  (dotenv).
Install it and add a few lines of code that inject these variables for your project
pip install python-dotenv
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()
# Now you can access environment variables like GCP_GCS_BUCKET and GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

Py4J - Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling (...)  java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: no further information;
If you're getting `Py4JavaError` with a generic root cause, such as the described above (Connection refused: no further information). You're most likely using incompatible versions of the JDK or Python with Spark.
As of the current latest Spark version (3.5.0), it supports JDK 8 / 11 / 17. All of which can be easily installed with SDKMan! on macOS or Linux environments

$ sdk install java 17.0.10-librca
$ sdk install spark 3.5.0
$ sdk install hadoop 3.3.5
As PySpark 3.5.0 supports Python 3.8+ make sure you're setting up your virtualenv with either 3.8 / 3.9 / 3.10 / 3.11 (Most importantly avoid using 3.12 for now as not all libs in the data-science/engineering ecosystem are fully package for that)


$ conda create -n ENV_NAME python=3.11
$ conda activate ENV_NAME
$ pip install pyspark==3.5.0
This setup makes installing `findspark` and the likes of it unnecessary. Happy coding.

✅The solution (for me) was:
pip install findspark on the command line and then
Add

Another possible solution is:
Check that pyspark is pointing to the correct location.
Run pyspark.__file__. It should be list /home/<your user name>/spark/spark-3.0.3-bin-hadoop3.2/python/pyspark/__init__.py if you followed the videos.
If it is pointing to your python site-packages remove the pyspark directory there and check that you have added the correct exports to you .bashrc file and that there are not any other exports which might supersede the ones provided in the course content.
To add to the solution above, if the errors persist in regards to setting the correct path for spark,  an alternative solution for permanent path setting solve the error is  to set environment variables on system and user environment variables following this tutorial: Install Apache PySpark on Windows PC | Apache Spark Installation Guide
Once everything is installed, skip to 7:14 to set up environment variables. This allows for the environment variables to be set permanently."

There’s a few extra steps to go into reading from GCS with PySpark
1.)  IMPORTANT: Download the Cloud Storage connector for Hadoop here: https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/connectors/cloud-storage#clusters
As the name implies, this .jar file is what essentially connects PySpark with your GCS
2.) Move the .jar file to your Spark file directory. I installed Spark using homebrew on my MacOS machine and I had to create a /jars directory under ""/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/ (where my spark dir is located)
3.) In your Python script, there are a few extra classes you’ll have to import:
import pyspark
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.conf import SparkConf
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
4.) You must set up your configurations before building your SparkSession. Here’s my code snippet:
conf = SparkConf() \
.setMaster('local[*]') \
.setAppName('test') \
.set(""spark.jars"", ""/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/jars/gcs-connector-hadoop3-latest.jar"") \
.set(""spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.enable"", ""true"") \
.set(""spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile"", ""path/to/google_credentials.json"")
sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)
sc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(""fs.AbstractFileSystem.gs.impl"",  ""com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFS"")
sc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(""fs.gs.impl"", ""com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystem"")
sc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(""fs.gs.auth.service.account.json.keyfile"", ""path/to/google_credentials.json"")
sc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(""fs.gs.auth.service.account.enable"", ""true"")
5.) Once you run that, build your SparkSession with the new parameters we’d just instantiated in the previous step:
spark = SparkSession.builder \
.config(conf=sc.getConf()) \
.getOrCreate()
6.) Finally, you’re able to read your files straight from GCS!

data-engineering-zoomcamp,Module 5: pyspark,TypeError when using spark.createDataFrame function on a pandas df,"Error:
spark.createDataFrame(df_pandas).schema
TypeError: field Affiliated_base_number: Can not merge type <class 'pyspark.sql.types.StringType'> and <class 'pyspark.sql.types.DoubleType'>
Solution:
Affiliated_base_number is a mix of letters and numbers (you can check this with a preview of the table), so it cannot be set to DoubleType (only for double-precision numbers). The suitable type would be StringType. Spark  inferSchema is more accurate than Pandas infer type method in this case. You can set it to  true  while reading the csv, so you don’t have to take out any data from your dataset. Something like this can help:
df = spark.read \
.options(
header = ""true"", \
inferSchema = ""true"", \
) \
.csv('path/to/your/csv/file/')
Solution B:
It's because some rows in the affiliated_base_number are null and therefore it is assigned the datatype String and this cannot be converted to type Double. So if you really want to convert this pandas df to a pyspark df only take the  rows from the pandas df that are not null in the 'Affiliated_base_number' column. Then you will be able to apply the pyspark function createDataFrame.
# Only take rows that have no null values
pandas_df= pandas_df[pandas_df.notnull().all(1)]"

Another way for achieving this is using the datediff (sql function). It receives this parameters
Upper Date: the closest date you have. For example dropoff_datetime
Lower Date: the farthest date you have.  For example pickup_datetime

Solution:
Downgrade your local PySpark to 3.3.1 (same as Dockerfile)
The reason for the failed connection in my case was the mismatch of PySpark versions. You can see that from the logs of spark-master in the docker container.
Solution 2:
Check what Spark version your local machine has

For some reason this worked - the Conda base doesn’t have the GCC installed - (GNU Compiler Collection) a compiler system that supports various programming languages. Without this the it fails to install pyproject.toml-based projects
“It's possible that in your specific environment, the gcc installation was required at the system level rather than within the virtual environment. This can happen if the build process for psycopg2 tries to access system-level dependencies during installation.
Installing gcc in your main Python installation (Conda) would make it available system-wide, allowing any Python environment to access it when necessary for building packages.”
gcc stands for GNU Compiler Collection. It is a compiler system developed by the GNU Project that supports various programming languages, including C, C++, Objective-C, and Fortran.
GCC is widely used for compiling source code written in these languages into executable programs or libraries. It's a key tool in the software development process, particularly in the compilation stage where source code is translated into machine code that can be executed by a computer's processor.
In addition to compiling source code, GCC also provides various optimization options, debugging support, and extensive documentation, making it a powerful and versatile tool for developers across different platforms and architectures.

This error indicates that there is a problem with the Python interpreter path specified in the shebang line. The presence of the \r character suggests that the script was edited or created in a Windows environment, causing the interpreter path to be incorrect when executed in Unix-like environments.
2 Solutions:
Either one or the other
Update Shebang Line:
Verify Python Interpreter Path: Use the which python3 command to determine the path to the Python 3 interpreter available in the current environment.
Update Shebang Line: Open the script file in a text editor. Modify the shebang line to point to the correct Python interpreter path found in the previous step. Ensure that the shebang line is consistent with the Python interpreter path in the execution environment.
Example Shebang Line:
Replace /usr/bin/env python3 with the correct Python interpreter path found using which python3.
Convert Line Endings:
Use the dos2unix command-line tool to convert the line endings of the script from Windows-style to Unix-style.

Q:In the Mage pipeline, individual blocks run successfully. However, when executing the pipeline as a whole, some blocks fail.
A: I have the following key-value pair in io_config.yaml file configured but still Mage blocks failed to generate OAuth and authenticate with GCP: GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACC_KEY_FILEPATH: ""{{ env_var('GCP_CREDENTIALS') }}"". The GCP_CREDENTIALS variable holds the full path to the service account key's JSON file. Adding the following line within the failed code block resolved the issue: os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = os.environ.get('GCP_CREDENTIALS').
This occurs because the path to profiles.yml is not correctly specified. You can rectify this by:
“export DBT_PROFILES_DBT=path/to/profiles.yml”
Eg., /home/src/magic-zoomcamp/dbt/project_name/
Do the similar for DBT_PROJECT_DIR if getting similar issue with dbt_project.yml.
Once DIRs are set,:
“dbt debug –config-dir”
This would update your paths. To maintain same path across sessions, use the path variables in your .env file.
To add triggers in mage pipelines via CLI, you can create a trigger of type API, and copy the API links.
Eg. link: http://localhost:6789/api/pipeline_schedules/10/pipeline_runs/f3a1a4228fc64cfd85295b668c93f3b2
Then create a trigger.py as such:
import os
import requests
class MageTrigger:
OPTIONS = {
""<pipeline_name>"": {
""trigger_id"": 10,
""key"": ""f3a1a4228fc64cfd85295b668c93f3b2""
}
}
@staticmethod
def trigger_pipeline(pipeline_name, variables=None):
trigger_id = MageTrigger.OPTIONS[pipeline_name][""trigger_id""]
key = MageTrigger.OPTIONS[pipeline_name][""key""]
endpoint = f""http://localhost:6789/api/pipeline_schedules/{trigger_id}/pipeline_runs/{key}""
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
payload = {}
if variables is not None:
payload['pipeline_run'] = {'variables': variables}
response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload)
return response
MageTrigger.trigger_pipeline(""<pipeline_name>"")
Finally, after the mage server is up an running, simply this command:
python trigger.py from mage directory in terminal.
Can I do data partitioning & clustering run by dbt pipeline, or I would need to do this manually in BigQuery afterwards?
You can use this configuration in your DBT model:
{
""field"": ""<field name>"",
""data_type"": ""<timestamp | date | datetime | int64>"",
""granularity"": ""<hour | day | month | year>""
# Only required if data_type is ""int64""
""range"": {
""start"": <int>,
""end"": <int>,
""interval"": <int>
}
}
and for clustering
{{
config(
materialized = ""table"",
cluster_by = ""order_id"",
)
}}

machine-learning-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Is it going to be live? When?,"The course videos are pre-recorded, you can start watching the course right now.
We will also occasionally have office hours - live sessions where we will answer your questions. The office hours sessions are recorded too.
You can see the office hours as well as the pre-recorded course videos in the course playlist on YouTube."
machine-learning-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,What if I miss a session?,"Everything is recorded, so you won’t miss anything. You will be able to ask your questions for office hours in advance and we will cover them during the live stream. Also, you can always ask questions in Slack."
machine-learning-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,How much theory will you cover?,"The bare minimum. The focus is more on practice, and we'll cover the theory only on the intuitive level.: https://mlbookcamp.com/article/python
For example, we won't derive the gradient update rule for logistic regression (there are other great courses for that), but we'll cover how to use logistic regression and make sense of the results."
machine-learning-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,I don't know math. Can I take the course?,"Yes! We'll cover some linear algebra in the course, but in general, there will be very few formulas, mostly code.
Here are some interesting videos covering linear algebra that you can already watch: ML Zoomcamp 1.8 - Linear Algebra Refresher from Alexey Grigorev or the excellent playlist from 3Blue1Brown Vectors | Chapter 1, Essence of linear algebra.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,The course videos are from the previous iteration. Will you release new ones or we’ll use the videos from 2021?,"We won’t re-record the course videos. The focus of the course and the skills we want to teach remained the same, and the videos are still up-to-date.
If you haven’t taken part in the previous iteration, you can start watching the videos. It’ll be useful for you and you will learn new things. However, we recommend using Python 3.10 now instead of Python 3.8."
machine-learning-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Submitting learning in public links,"When you post about what you learned from the course on your social media pages, use the tag #mlzoomcamp. When you submit your homework, there’s a section in the form for putting the links there. Separate multiple links by any whitespace character (linebreak, space, tab, etc).
For posting the learning in public links, you get extra scores. But the number of scores is limited to 7 points: if you put more than 7 links in your homework form, you’ll get only 7 points.
The same content can be posted to 7 different social sites and still earn you 7 points if you add 7 URLs per week, see Alexey’s reply. (~ ellacharmed)
For midterms/capstones, the awarded points are doubled as the duration is longer. So for projects the points are capped at 14 for 14 URLs."
machine-learning-zoomcamp,General course-related questions,Adding community notes,"You can create your own github repository for the course with your notes, homework, projects, etc.
Then fork the original course repo and add a link under the 'Community Notes' section to the notes that are in your own repo.
After that's done, create a pull request to sync your fork with the original course repo.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,1. Introduction to Machine Learning,wget is not recognized as an internal or external command,"If you get “wget is not recognized as an internal or external command”, you need to install it.
On Ubuntu, run
sudo apt-get install wget
On Windows, the easiest way to install wget is to use Chocolatey:
choco install wget
Or you can download a binary from here and put it to any location in your PATH (e.g. C:/tools/)
On Mac, the easiest way to install wget is to use brew.
Brew install wget
Alternatively, you can use a Python wget library, but instead of simply using “wget” you’ll need eeeto use
python -m wget
You need to install it with pip first:
pip install wget
And then in your python code, for example in your jupyter notebook, use:
import wget
wget.download(""URL"")
This should download whatever is at the URL in the same directory as your code.
(Memoona Tahira)
Alternatively, you can read a CSV file from a URL directly with pandas:
url = ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/housing.csv""
df = pd.read_csv(url)
Valid URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, gs, and file.
In some cases you might need to bypass https checks:
import ssl
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
Or you can use the built-in Python functionality for downloading the files:
import urllib.request
url = ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/housing.csv""
urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, ""housing.csv"")
Urllib.request.urlretrieve() is a standard Python library function available on all devices and platforms. URL requests and URL data retrieval are done with the urllib.request module.
The urlretrieve() function allows you to download files from URLs and save them locally. Python programs use it to download files from the internet.
On any Python-enabled device or platform, you can use the urllib.request.urlretrieve() function to download the file.
(Mohammad Emad Sharifi)"
machine-learning-zoomcamp,1. Introduction to Machine Learning,Retrieving csv inside notebook,"You can use
!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/housing.csv
To download the data too. The exclamation mark !, lets you execute shell commands inside your notebooks. This works generally for shell commands such as ls, cp, mkdir, mv etc . . .
For instance, if you then want to move your data into a data directory alongside your notebook-containing directory, you could execute the following:
!mkdir -p ../data/
!mv housing.csv ../data/"

machine-learning-zoomcamp,1. Introduction to Machine Learning,Singular Matrix Error,"I'm trying to invert the matrix but I got error that the matrix is singular matrix
The singular matrix error is caused by the fact that not every matrix can be inverted. In particular, in the homework it happens because you have to pay close attention when dealing with multiplication (the method .dot) since multiplication is not commutative! X.dot(Y) is not necessarily equal to Y.dot(X), so respect the order otherwise you get the wrong matrix."

machine-learning-zoomcamp,1. Introduction to Machine Learning,Read-in the File in Windows OS,"How do I read the dataset with Pandas in Windows?
I used the code below but not working
df = pd.read_csv('C:\Users\username\Downloads\data.csv')
Unlike Linux/Mac OS, Windows uses the backslash (\) to navigate the files that cause the conflict with Python. The problem with using the backslash is that in Python, the '\' has a purpose known as an escape sequence. Escape sequences allow us to include special characters in strings, for example, ""\n"" to add a new line or ""\t"" to add spaces, etc. To avoid the issue we just need to add ""r"" before the file path and Python will treat it as a literal string (not an escape sequence).
Here’s how we should be loading the file instead:
df = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\username\Downloads\data.csv')

A: linear regression is a pretty simple model, it neither can nor should fit 100% (nor any other model, as this would be the sign of overfitting). This picture might illustrate some intuition behind this, imagine X is a single feature:
As our model is linear, how would you draw a line to fit all the ""dots""?

The long tail (red curve) is the result of having a few observations with high values, now the behaviour of the distribution changes, first of all, the area is different on each side and now the mean, median and mode are different.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,3. Machine Learning for Classification,Could not convert string to float:’Nissan’rt string to float: 'Nissan',"The error message “could not convert string to float: ‘Nissan’” typically occurs when a machine learning model or function is expecting numerical input, but receives a string instead. In this case, it seems like the model is trying to convert the car brand ‘Nissan’ into a numerical value, which isn’t possible.
To resolve this issue, you can encode categorical variables like car brands into numerical values. One common method is one-hot encoding, which creates new binary columns for each category/label present in the original column.
Here’s an example of how you can perform one-hot encoding using pandas:
import pandas as pd
# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame and 'brand' is the column with car brands
data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['brand'])
In this code, pd.get_dummies() creates a new DataFrame where the ‘brand’ column is replaced with binary columns for each brand (e.g., ‘brand_Nissan’, ‘brand_Toyota’, etc.). Each row in the DataFrame has a 1 in the column that corresponds to its brand and 0 in all other brand columns.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,3. Machine Learning for Classification,Why did we change the targets to binary format when calculating mutual information score in the homework?,"Solution: Mutual Information score calculates the relationship between categorical variables or discrete variables. So in the homework, because the target which is median_house_value is continuous, we had to change it to binary format which in other words, makes its values discrete as either 0 or 1. If we allowed it to remain in the continuous variable format, the mutual information score could be calculated, but the algorithm would have to divide the continuous variables into bins and that would be highly subjective. That is why continuous variables are not used for mutual information score calculation.

Yes. I think it is only on df_train. The reason behind this is that df_train_full also contains the validation dataset, so at this stage we don't want to make conclusions based on the validation data, since we want to test how we did without using that portion of the data.

When we apply the fit method, this method is looking at the content of the df_train dictionaries we are passing to the DictVectorizer instance, and fit is figuring out (training) how to map the values of these dictionaries. If categorical, applies one-hot encoding, if numerical it will leave it as it is.
With this context, if we apply the fit to the validation model, we are ""giving the answers"" and we are not letting the ""fit"" do its job for data that we haven't seen. By not applying the fit to the validation model we can know how well it was trained.
Below is an extract of Alexey's book explaining this point.
Humberto Rodriguez
There is no need to initialize another instance of dictvectorizer after fitting it on the train set as it will overwrite what it learnt from being fit on the train data.

sag Solver: The sag solver stands for ""Stochastic Average Gradient."" It's particularly suitable for large datasets, as it optimizes the regularization term using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). sag can be faster than some other solvers for large datasets.
Alpha: The alpha parameter  controls the strength of the regularization in Ridge regression. A higher alpha value leads to stronger regularization, which means the model will have smaller coefficient values, reducing the risk of overfitting.

ridge = Ridge(alpha=alpha, solver='sag', random_state=42)

machine-learning-zoomcamp,3. Machine Learning for Classification,pandas.get_dummies() and DictVectorizer(sparse=False) produce the same type of one-hot encodings:,"DictVectorizer(sparse=True) produces CSR format, which is both more memory efficient and converges better during fit(). Basically it stores non-zero values and indices instead of adding a column for each class of each feature (models of cars produced 900+ columns alone in the current task).
Using “sparse” format like on the picture above, both via pandas.get_dummies() and DictVectorizer(sparse=False) - is slower (around 6-8min for Q6 task - Linear/Ridge Regression) for high amount of classes (like models of cars for eg) and gives a bit “worse” results in both Logistic and Linear/Ridge Regression, while also producing convergence warnings for Linear/Ridge Regression.

Dmytro Durach
(Oscar Garcia)  Use a StandardScaler for the numeric fields and OneHotEncoder (sparce = False) for the categorical features.  This help with the warning. Separate the features (num/cat) without using the encoder first and see if that helps."
machine-learning-zoomcamp,3. Machine Learning for Classification,Dealing with Convergence in Week 3 q6,"When encountering convergence errors during the training of a Ridge regression model, consider the following steps:
Feature Normalization: Normalize your numerical features using techniques like MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler. This ensures that numerical features are on a 	similar scale, preventing convergence issues.
Categorical Feature Encoding: If your dataset includes categorical features, apply 	categorical encoding techniques such as OneHotEncoder (OHE) to 	convert them into a numerical format. OHE is commonly used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors, making them compatible with regression models like Ridge.
Combine Features: After 	normalizing numerical features and encoding categorical features using OneHotEncoder, combine them to form a single feature matrix (X_train). This combined dataset serves as the input for training the Ridge regression model.
By following these steps, you can address convergence errors and enhance the stability of your Ridge model training process. It's important to note that the choice of encoding method, such as OneHotEncoder, is appropriate for handling categorical features in this context.
You can find an example here.

Machine Learning for Classification,Sparse matrix compared dense matrix,"A sparse matrix is more memory-efficient because it only stores the non-zero values and their positions in memory. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets with many zero or missing values.
The default DictVectorizer configuration is a sparse matrix. For week3 Q6 using the default sparse is an interesting option because of the size of the matrix. Training the model was also more performant and didn’t give an error message like dense mode.

Machine Learning for Classification,Features for homework Q5,"Do we need to train the model only with the features: total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population and households? or with all the available features and then pop once at a time each of the previous features and train the model to make the accuracy comparison?
You need to create a list of all features in this question and evaluate the model one time to obtain the accuracy, this will be the original accuracy, and then remove one feature each time, and in each time, train the model, find the accuracy and the difference between the original accuracy and the found accuracy. Finally, find out which feature has the smallest absolute accuracy difference.
While calculating differences between accuracy scores while training on the whole model, versus dropping one feature at a time and comparing its accuracy to the model to judge impact of the feature on the accuracy of the model, do we take the smallest difference or smallest absolute difference?
Since order of subtraction between the two accuracy scores can result in a negative number, we will take its absolute value as we are interested in the smallest value difference, not the lowest difference value. Case in point, if difference is -4 and -2, the smallest difference is abs(-2), and not abs(-4)"

Did you try using a different random_state? From my understanding, KFold just makes N (which is equal to n_splits) separate pairs of datasets (train+val).
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html
In my case changing random state changed results
(Arthur Minakhmetov)
Changing the random state makes a difference in my case too, but not whether it is inside or outside the for loop. I think I have got the answer. kFold = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle = True, random_state = 1)  is just a generator object and it contains only the information n_splits, shuffle and random_state. The k-fold splitting actually happens in the next for loop for train_idx, val_idx in kFold.split(df_full_train): . So it doesn't matter where we generate the object, before or after the first loop. It will generate the same information. But from the programming point of view, it is better to do it before the loop. No point doing it again and again inside the loop
(Bhaskar Sarma)
In case of KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=1) and C= [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10], it is better to loop through the different values of Cs as the video explained. I had separate train() and predict() functions, which were reused after dividing the dataset via KFold. The model ran about 10 minutes and provided a good score.

FPR is 0.0
And TPR is 0.0
When the threshold is 1.0, the condition for belonging to the positive class (churn class) is g(x)>=1.0 But g(x) is a sigmoid function for a binary classification problem. It has values between 0 and 1. This function  never becomes equal to outermost values, i.e. 0 and 1.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,4.

Although the following two options end up with the same ratio, the data itself is a bit different and not 100% matching in each case.
1)
df_train, df_temp = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.4, random_state=42)
df_val, df_test = train_test_split(df_temp, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

machine-learning-zoomcamp,4. Evaluation Metrics for Classification,Why do we use cross validation?,"Cross-validation evaluates the performance of a model and chooses the best hyperparameters. Cross-validation does this by splitting the dataset into multiple parts (folds), typically 5 or 10. It then trains and evaluates your model multiple times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining folds as the training set.
""C"" is a hyperparameter that is typically associated with regularization in models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and logistic regression.
Smaller ""C"" values: They introduce more regularization, which means the model will try to find a simpler decision boundary, potentially underfitting the data. This is because it penalizes the misclassification of training examples more severely.
Larger ""C"" values: They reduce the regularization effect, allowing the model to fit the training data more closely, potentially overfitting. This is because it penalizes misclassification less severely, allowing the model to prioritize getting training examples correct.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,4. Evaluation Metrics for Classification,When do I use ROC vs Precision-Recall curves?,"- ROC curves are appropriate when the observations are balanced between each class, whereas precision-recall curves are appropriate for imbalanced datasets.
- The reason for this recommendation is that ROC curves present an optimistic picture of the model on datasets with a class imbalance.
-This is because of the use of true negatives in the False Positive Rate in the ROC Curve and the careful avoidance of this rate in the Precision-Recall curve.
- If the proportion of positive to negative instances changes in a test set, the ROC curves will not change. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, lift and F scores use values from both columns of the confusion matrix. As a class distribution changes these measures will change as well, even if the fundamental classifier performance does not. ROC graphs are based upon TP rate and FP rate, in which each dimension is a strict columnar ratio, so cannot give an accurate picture of performance when there is class imbalance.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,5. Deploying Machine Learning Models,"Errors related to the default environment: WSL, Ubuntu, proper Python version, installing pipenv etc.","While weeks 1-4 can relatively easily be followed and the associated homework completed with just about any default environment / local setup, week 5 introduces several layers of abstraction and dependencies.
It is advised to prepare your “homework environment” with a cloud provider of your choice. A thorough step-by-step guide for doing so for an AWS EC2 instance is provided in an introductory video taken from the MLOPS course here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSiYkP23zo
Note that (only) small AWS instances can be run for free, and that larger ones will be billed hourly based on usage (but can and should be stopped when not in use).
Alternative ways are sketched here:

Go to settings, API and click `Create New Token`. This will download a `kaggle.json` file which contains your `username` and `key` information
In the same location as your Jupyter NB, place the `kaggle.json` file
Run `!chmod 600 <ENTER YOUR FILEPATH>/kaggle.json`
Make sure to import os via `import os` and then run:
os.environ['KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR'] = <STRING OF YOUR FILE PATH>
Finally you can run directly in your NB: `!kaggle datasets download -d kapturovalexander/bank-credit-scoring`
And then you can unzip the file and access the CSV via: `!unzip -o bank-credit-scoring.zip`

machine-learning-zoomcamp,5. Deploying Machine Learning Models,How to install WSL on Windows 10 and 11 ?,"It is quite simple, and you can follow these instructions here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYlgUDKKK5A&ab_channel=NeuralNine
Make sure that you have “Virtual Machine Platform” feature activated in your Windows “Features”. To do that, search “features” in the research bar and see if the checkbox is selected. You also need to make sure that your system (in the bios) is able to virtualize. This is usually the case.
In the Microsoft Store: look for ‘Ubuntu’ or ‘Debian’ (or any linux distribution you want) and install it
Once it is downloaded, open the app and choose a username and a password (secured one). When you type your password, nothing will show in the window, which is normal: the writing is invisible.
You are now inside of your linux system. You can test some commands such as “pwd”. You are not in your Windows system.
To go to your windows system: you need to go back two times with cd ../.. And then go to the “mnt” directory with cd mnt. If you list here your files, you will see your disks. You can move to the desired folder, for example here I moved to the ML_Zoomcamp folder:
Python should be already installed but you can check it by running sudo apt install python3 command.
You can make your actual folder your default folder when you open your Ubuntu terminal with this command : echo ""cd ../../mnt/your/folder/path"" >> ~/.bashrc
You can disable bell sounds (when you type something that does not exist for example) by modifying the inputrc file with this command: sudo vim /etc/inputrc
You have to uncomment the set bell-style none line -> to do that, press the “i” keyboard letter (for insert) and go with your keyboard to this line. Delete the # and then press the Escape keyboard touch and finally press “:wq” to write (it saves your modifications) then quit.
You can check that your modifications are taken into account by opening a new terminal (you can pin it to your task bar so you do not have to go to the Microsoft app each time).
You will need to install pip by running this command sudo apt install python3-pip
NB: I had this error message when trying to install pipenv (https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5663):
/sbin/ldconfig.real: Can't link /usr/lib/wsl/lib/libnvoptix_loader.so.1 to libnvoptix.so.1

machine-learning-zoomcamp,5. Deploying Machine Learning Models,Why do we need the --rm flag,"What is the reason we don’t want to keep the docker image in our system and why do we need to run docker containers with `--rm` flag?
For best practice, you don’t want to have a lot of abandoned docker images in your system. You just update it in your folder and trigger the build one more time.
They consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.
The right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.
The option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.
During development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in. You can move it around, maintain it in a repository, share it. Then we use the image to spin up instances of it and they are called containers.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,5. Deploying Machine Learning Models,Failed to read Dockerfile,"When you create the dockerfile the name should be dockerfile and needs to be without extension. One of the problems we can get at this point is to create the dockerfile as a dockerfile extension Dockerfile.dockerfile which creates an error when we build the docker image. Instead we just need to create the file without extension: Dockerfile and will run perfectly.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,5. Deploying Machine Learning Models,Where does pipenv create environments and how does it name them?,"It creates them in
OSX/Linux: ~/.local/share/virtualenvs/folder-name_cyrptic-hash
Windows: C:\Users\<USERNAME>\.virtualenvs\folder-name_cyrptic-hash
Eg: C:\Users\Ella\.virtualenvs\code-qsdUdabf (for module-05 lesson)
The environment name is the name of the last folder in the folder directory where we used the pipenv install command (or any other pipenv command). E.g. If you run any pipenv command in folder path ~/home/user/Churn-Flask-app, it will create an environment named Churn-Flask-app-some_random_characters, and it's path will be like this: /home/user/.local/share/virtualenvs/churn-flask-app-i_mzGMjX.
All libraries of this environment will be installed inside this folder. To activate this environment, I will need to cd into the project folder again, and type pipenv shell. In short, the location of the project folder acts as an identifier for an environment, in place of any name.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,6. Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning,What is eta in XGBoost,"Sometimes someone might wonder what eta means in the tunable hyperparameters of XGBoost and how it helps the model.
ETA is the learning rate of the model. XGBoost uses gradient descent to calculate and update the model. In gradient descent, we are looking for the minimum weights that help the model to learn the data very well. This minimum weights for the features is updated each time the model passes through the features and learns the features during training. Tuning the learning rate helps you tell the model what speed it would use in deriving the minimum for the weights."
machine-learning-zoomcamp,6. Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning,What is the difference between bagging and boosting?,"For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.
Random Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.
XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.
Note that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.
Mélanie Fouesnard
Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.

If you get an error message like this:
ValueError: The channel dimension of the inputs should be defined. The input_shape received is (None, None, None, None), where axis -1 (0-based) is the channel dimension, which found to be `None`.
Solution:
Saving a model (either yourself via model.save() or via checkpoint when save_weights_only = False) saves two things: The trained model weights (for example the best weights found during training) and the model architecture.  If the number of channels is not explicitly specified in the Input layer of the model, and is instead defined as a variable, the model architecture will not have the value in the variable stored. Therefore when the model is reloaded, it will complain about not knowing the number of channels. See the code below, in the first line, you need to specify number of channels explicitly:

for subdir in sorted(os.listdir(directory)):
…
Reference: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/preprocessing/image.py, line 563
This means folders will be read in alphabetical order. For example, in the case of a folder named dino, and another named dragon, dino will read first and will have class label 0, whereas dragon will be read in next and will have class label 1.
When a Keras model predicts binary labels, it will only return one value, and this is the probability of class 1 in case of sigmoid activation function in the last dense layer with 2 neurons. The probability of class 0 can be found out by:
prob(class(0)) = 1- prob(class(1))
In case of using from_logits to get results, you will get two values for each of the labels.
A prediction of 0.8 is saying the probability that the image has class label 1 (in this case dragon), is 0.8, and conversely we can infer the probability that the image has class label 0 is 0.2.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,8. Neural Networks and Deep Learning,Q: Where does the number of Conv2d layer’s params come from? Where does the number of “features” we get after the Flatten layer come from?,"Let’s say we define our Conv2d layer like this:
>> tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3))
It means our input image is RGB (3 channels, 150 by 150 pixels), kernel is 3x3 and number of filters (layer’s width) is 32.
If we check model.summary() we will get this:
_________________________________________________________________
Layer (type)                Output Shape              Param #
=================================================================
conv2d (Conv2D)             (None, 148, 148, 32)      896
So where does 896 params come from? It’s computed like this:
>>> (3*3*3 +1) * 32
896
# 3x3 kernel, 3 channels RGB, +1 for bias, 32 filters
What about the number of “features” we get after the Flatten layer?
For our homework model.summary() for last MaxPooling2d and Flatten layers looked like this:
_________________________________________________________________
Layer (type)                Output Shape              Param #
=================================================================
max_pooling2d_3       (None, 7, 7, 128)         0
flatten (Flatten)           (None, 6272)              0
So where do 6272 vectors come from? It’s computed like this:
>>> 7*7*128
6272
# 7x7 “image shape” after several convolutions and poolings, 128 filters

machine-learning-zoomcamp,8. Neural Networks and Deep Learning,Sequential vs. Functional Model Modes in Keras (TF2),"It’s quite useful to understand that all types of models in the course are a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor (Sequential model TF page, Sequential class).
You can simply start from an “empty” model and add more and more layers in a sequential order.
This mode is called “Sequential Model API”  (easier)
In Alexey’s videos it is implemented as chained calls of different entities (“inputs”,“base”, “vectors”,  “outputs”) in a more advanced mode “Functional Model API”.
Maybe a more complicated way makes sense when you do Transfer Learning and want to separate “Base” model vs. rest, but in the HW you need to recreate the full model from scratch ⇒ I believe it is easier to work with a sequence of “similar” layers.
You can read more about it in this TF2 tutorial.
A really useful Sequential model example is shared in the Kaggle’s “Bee or Wasp” dataset folder with code: notebook

In the unit 9.6, Alexey ran the command echo ${REMOTE_URI} which turned the URI address in the terminal.

One caveat is that you will lose this variable once the session is terminated.
I also had the same problem on Ubuntu terminal. I executed the following two commands:
$ export REMOTE_URI=1111111111.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/clothing-tflite-images:clothing-model-xception-v4-001
$ echo $REMOTE_URI
111111111.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/clothing-tflite-images:clothing-model-xception-v4-001

While passing local testing of the lambda function without issues, trying to test the same input with a running docker instance results in an error message like

This happens when a model (in this case the dino vs dragon model) returns individual estimation values as numpy float32 values (arrays). They need to be converted individually to base-Python floats in order to become “serializable”.
Solution:
In my particular case, I set up the dino vs dragon model in such a way as to return a label + predicted probability for each class as follows (below is a two-line extract of function predict() in the lambda_function.py):
preds = [interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0], \
1-interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0]]
In which case the above described solution will look like this:
preds = [float(interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0]), \
float(1-interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0])]
The rest can be made work by following the chapter 9 (and/or chapter 5!) lecture videos step by step.

If this call came from a _pb2.py file, your generated code is out of date and must be regenerated with protoc >= 3.19.0.
If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, some other possible workarounds are:

”Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?”
Solution: The solution is simple. The Docker Desktop might no longer be connecting to the WSL Linux distro. What you need to do is go to your Docker Desktop setting and then click on resources. Under resources, click on WSL Integration. You will get a tab like the image below:
Just enable additional distros. That’s all. Even if the additional distro is the same as the default WSL distro.

If this call came from a _pb2.py file, your generated code is out of date and must be regenerated with protoc >= 3.19.0.
If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, some other possible workarounds are:
1. Downgrade the protobuf package to 3.20.x or lower.
2. Set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python (but this will use pure-Python parsing and will be much slower).

machine-learning-zoomcamp,10. Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving,"Why cpu vals for Kubernetes deployment.yaml look like “100m” and “500m”? What does ""m"" mean?","In Kubernetes resource specifications, such as CPU requests and limits, the ""m"" stands for milliCPU, which is a unit of computing power. It represents one thousandth of a CPU core.
cpu: ""100m"" means the container is requesting 100 milliCPUs, which is equivalent to 0.1 CPU core.
cpu: ""500m"" means the container has a CPU limit of 500 milliCPUs, which is equivalent to 0.5 CPU core.
These values are specified in milliCPUs to allow fine-grained control over CPU resources. It allows you to express CPU requirements and limits in a more granular way, especially in scenarios where your application might not need a full CPU core.

Answer:
The link provided for example (2023/Capstone link ): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgoepohpgbM4MWTAHWuXa6r3NXKnxKcg4NDOm0bElAdXdnnA/viewform contains a list of all submitted projects to be evaluated. More specific, you are to review 3 assigned peer projects. In the spreadsheet are 3 hash values of your assigned peer projects. However, you need to derive the your hash value of your email address and find the value on the spreadsheet under the (reviewer_hash) heading.
To calculate your hash value run the python code below:
from hashlib import sha1
def compute_hash(email):
return sha1(email.lower().encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
# Example usage **** enter your email below (Example1@gmail.com)****
email = ""Example1@gmail.com""
hashed_email = compute_hash(email)
print(""Original Email:"", email)
print(""Hashed Email (SHA-1):"", hashed_email)
Edit the above code to replace Example1@gmail.com as your email address
Store and run the above python code from your terminal. See below as the Hashed Email (SHA-1) value
You then go to the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR-7RRtq7AMx5OzI-tDbkzsbxNLm-NvFOP5OfJmhCek9oYcDx5jzxtZW2ZqWvBqc395UZpHBv1of9R1/pubhtml?gid=876309294&single=true
Lastly, copy the “Hashed Email (SHA-1): bd9770be022dede87419068aa1acd7a2ab441675” value and search for 3 identical entries. There you should see your peer project to be reviewed.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,Miscellaneous,Pickle error: can’t get attribute XXX on module __main__,"When running a docker container with waitress serving the app.py for making predictions, pickle will throw an error that can't get attribute <name_of_class> on module __main__.
This does not happen when Flask is used directly, i.e. not through waitress.
The problem is that the model uses a custom column transformer class, and when the model was saved, it was saved from the __main__ module (e.g. python train.py). Pickle will reference the class in the global namespace (top-level code): __main__.<custom_class>.
When using waitress, waitress will load the predict_app module and this will call pickle.load, that will try to find __main__.<custom_class> that does not exist.
Solution:
Put the class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model (e.g. train.py) and the script that loads the model (e.g. predict.py)
Note: If Flask is used (no waitress) in predict.py, and predict.py has the definition of the class, When  it is run: python predict.py, it will work because the class is in the same namespace as the one used when the model was saved (__main__).

machine-learning-zoomcamp,Miscellaneous,BentoML not working with –production flag at any stage: e.g. with bentoml serve and while running the bentoml container,"You might see a long error message with something about sparse matrices, and in the swagger UI, you get a code 500 error with “” (empty string) as output.
Potential reason: Setting DictVectorizer or OHE to sparse while training, and then storing this in a pipeline or custom object in the benotml model saving stage in train.py. This means that when the custom object is called in service.py, it will convert each input to a different sized sparse matrix, and this can't be batched due to inconsistent length. In this case, bentoml model signatures should have batchable set to False for production during saving the bentoml mode in train.py.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,Miscellaneous,About getting the wrong result when multiplying matrices,"When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.
For example:
A (m x n) * B (n x p) = C (m x p)
B (n x p) * A (m x n) = D (n x n)
C and D are matrices of different sizes and usually have different values. Therefore the order is important in matrix multiplication and changing the order changes the result.

machine-learning-zoomcamp,Miscellaneous,Is it best to train your model only on the most important features?,"I’m just looking back at the lessons in week 3 (churn prediction project), and lesson 3.6 talks about Feature Importance for categorical values. At 8.12, the mutual info scores show that the some features are more important than others, but then in lesson 3.10 the Logistic Regression model is trained on all of the categorical variables (see 1:35). Once we have done feature importance, is it best to train your model only on the most important features?
Not necessarily - rather, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included (so, e.g. predict with & without including that feature; if excluding it drops performance, keep it, else drop it). A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine. There are many feature selection algorithms, it might be interesting to read up on them (among the methods we've learned so far in this course, L1 regularization (Lasso) implicitly does feature selection by shrinking some weights all the way to zero).

machine-learning-zoomcamp,Miscellaneous,"How can I work with very large datasets, e.g. the New York Yellow Taxi dataset, with over a million rows?","You can consider several different approaches:
Sampling: In the exploratory phase, you can use random samples of the data.
Chunking: When you do need all the data, you can read and process it in chunks that do fit in the memory.
Optimizing data types: Pandas’ automatic data type inference (when reading data in) might result in e.g. float64 precision being used to represent integers, which wastes space. You might achieve substantial memory reduction by optimizing the data types.
Using Dask, an open-source python project which parallelizes Numpy and Pandas.

mlops-zoomcamp,Module 1: Introduction,AWS costs,"I am worried about the cost of keeping an AWS instance running during the course.
With the instance specified during working environment setup, if you remember to Stop Instance once you finished your work for the day.  Using that strategy, in a day with about 5 hours of work you will pay around $0.40 USD which will account for $12 USD per month, which seems to be an affordable amount.
You must remember that you would have a different IP public address every time you Restart your instance, and you would need to edit your ssh Config file.  It's worth the time though.
Additionally, AWS enables you to set up an automatic email alert if a predefined budget is exceeded.
Here is a tutorial to set this up.
Also, you can estimate the cost yourself, using AWS pricing calculator (to use it you don’t even need to be logged in).
At the time of writing (20.05.2023) t3a.xlarge instance with 2 hr/day usage (which translates to 10 hr/week that should be enough to complete the course) and 30GB EBS monthly cost is 10.14 USD

Added by Muhammed Çelik
The disconnection will occur whether I SSH via WSL2 or via VS Code, and usually occurs after I run some code, i.e. “import mlflow”, so not particularly intense computation.
I cannot reconnect to the instance without stopping and restarting with a new IPv4 address.
I’ve gone through steps listed on this page: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-linux-resolve-ssh-connection-errors/
Inbound rule should allow all incoming IPs for SSH.
What I expect to happen:
SSH connection should remain while I’m actively using the instance, and if it does disconnect, I should be able to reconnect back.
Solution: sometimes the hang ups are caused by the instance running out of memory. In one instance, using EC2 feature to view screenshot of the instance as a means to troubleshoot, it was the OS out-of-memory feature which killed off some critical processes. In this case, if we can’t use a higher compute VM with more RAM, try adding a swap file, which uses the disk as RAM substitute and prevents the OOM error. Follow Ubuntu’s documentation here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq.
Alternatively follow AWS’s own doc, which mirrors Ubuntu’s: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-memory-swap-file/"

Solution: The DictVectorizer creates an initial mapping for the features (columns). When calling the DictVecorizer again for the validation dataset transform should be used as it will ignore features that it did not see when fit_transform was last called. E.g.
X_train = dv.fit_transform(train_dict)

NOTE: if you’re using Conda instead of pip, install fastparquet rather than pyarrow, as it is much easier to install and it’s functionally identical to pyarrow for our needs."
mlops-zoomcamp,Module 1: Introduction,No RMSE value in the options,"The evaluation RMSE I get doesn’t figure within the options!
If you’re evaluating the model on the entire February data, try to filter outliers using the same technique you used on the train data (0≤duration≤60) and you’ll get a RMSE which is (approximately) in the options. Also don’t forget to convert the columns data types to str before using the DictVectorizer.
Another option: Along with filtering outliers, additionally filter on null values by replacing them with -1.  You will get a RMSE which is (almost same as) in the options. Use ‘.round(2)’ method to round it to 2 decimal points.

mlops-zoomcamp,Module 1: Introduction,RMSE on test set too high,"Problem: RMSE on test set was too high when hot encoding the validation set with a previously fitted OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=’ignore’) on the training set, while DictVectorizer would yield the correct RMSE.
In principle both transformers should behave identically when treating categorical features (at least in this week’s homework where we don’t have sequences of strings in each row):
Features are put into binary columns encoding their presence (1) or absence (0)
Unknown categories are imputed as zeroes in the hot-encoded matrix"
mlops-zoomcamp,Module 1: Introduction,Q: Using of OneHotEncoder instead of DictVectorizer,"A: Alexey’s answer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uJ36ZZr_Is&t=13s
In summary,
pd.get_dummies or OHE can come up with result in different orders and handle missing data differently, so train and val set would have different columns during train and validation
DictVectorizer would ignore missing (in train) and new (in val) datasets

mlops-zoomcamp,Module 1: Introduction,Q: Why did we not use OneHotEncoder(sklearn) instead of DictVectorizer ?,"Why didn't get_dummies in pandas library or OneHotEncoder in scikit-learn library be used for one-hot encoding? I know OneHotEncoder is the most common and useful. One-hot coding can also be done using the eye or identity components of the NumPy library.
M.Sari
OneHotEncoder has the option to output a row column tuple matrix. DictVectorizer is a one step method to encode and support row column tuple matrix output.

mlops-zoomcamp,Module 1: Introduction,Clipping outliers,"How to check that we removed the outliers?
Use the pandas function describe() which can provide a report of the data distribution along with the statistics to describe the data. For example, after clipping the outliers using boolean expression, the min and max can be verified using
df[‘duration’].describe()"
mlops-zoomcamp,Module 1: Introduction,Replacing NaNs for pickup location and drop off location with -1 for One-Hot Encoding,"pd.get_dummies and DictVectorizer both create a one-hot encoding on string values. Therefore you need to convert the values in PUlocationID and DOlocationID to string.
If you convert the values in PUlocationID and DOlocationID from numeric to string, the NaN values get converted to the string ""nan"".  With DictVectorizer the RMSE is the same whether you use ""nan"" or ""-1"" as string representation for the NaN values. Therefore the representation doesn't have to be ""-1"" specifically, it could also be some other string."
mlops-zoomcamp,Module 1: Introduction,Slightly different RSME,"Problem: My LinearRegression RSME is very close to the answer but not exactly the same. Is this normal?
Answer: No, LinearRegression is an deterministic model, it should always output the same results when given the same inputs.
Answer:
Check if you have treated the outlier properly for both train and validation sets
Check if the one hot encoding has been done properly by looking at the shape of one hot encoded feature matrix. If it shows 2 features, there is wrong with one hot encoding. Hint: the drop off and pick up codes need to be converted to proper data format and then DictVectorizer is fitted.

mlops-zoomcamp,Module 1: Introduction,Extremely low RSME,"Problem: I’m facing an extremely low RMSE score (eg: 4.3451e-6) - what shall I do?
Answer: Recheck your code to see if your model is learning the target prior to making the prediction. If the target variable is passed in as a parameter while fitting the model, chances are the model would score extremely low. However, that’s not what you would want and would much like to have your model predict that. A good way to check that is to make sure your X_train doesn’t contain any part of your y_train. The same stands for validation too.

Solution: There are two plausible errors to this. Both are in the hpo.py file where the hyper-parameter tuning is run. The objective function should look like this.

   def objective(params):
# It's important to set the ""with"" statement and the ""log_params"" function here
# in order to properly log all the runs and parameters.
with mlflow.start_run():
# Log the parameters
mlflow.log_params(params)
rf = RandomForestRegressor(**params)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = rf.predict(X_valid)
# Calculate and log rmse
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_valid, y_pred, squared=False)
mlflow.log_metric('rmse', rmse)
If you add the with statement before this function, and just after the following line
X_valid, y_valid = load_pickle(os.path.join(data_path, ""valid.pkl""))
and you log the parameters just after the search_space dictionary is defined, like this
search_space = {....}
# Log the parameters
mlflow.log_params(search_space)
Then there is a risk that the parameters will be logged in group. As a result, the
params = space_eval(SPACE, params)
register_model.py file will receive the parameters in group, while in fact it expects to receive them one by one. Thus, make sure that the objective function looks as above.

The --max_evals argument in hpo.py has no defined datatype and will therefore implicitly be treated as string. It should be an integer, so that the script can work correctly. Add type=int to the argument definition:
parser.add_argument(

mlops-zoomcamp,Module 2: Experiment tracking,Viewing MLflow Experiments using MLflow CLI,"Problem: After starting the tracking server, when we try to use the mlflow cli commands as listed here, most of them can’t seem to find the experiments that have been run with the tracking server
Solution: We need to set the environment variable MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI to the URI of the sqlite database. This is something like “export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=sqlite:///{path to sqlite database}” . After this, we can view the experiments from the command line using commands like “mlflow experiments search”
Even after this commands like “mlflow gc” doesn’t seem to get the tracking uri, and they have to be passed explicitly as an argument every time the command is run.

The same applies for any SQL backed database such as postgres as well.

mlops-zoomcamp,Module 3: Orchestration,Why do we use Jan/Feb/March for Train/Test/Validation Purposes?,"Problem: Someone asked why we are using this type of split approach instead of just a random split.
Solution: For example, I have some models at work that train on Jan 1 2020 — Aug 1 2021 time period, and then test on Aug 1 - Dec 31 2021, and finally validate on Jan - March or something
We do these “out of time”  validations to do a few things:
Check for seasonality of our data
We know if the RMSE for Test is 5 say, and then RMSE for validation is 20, then there’s serious seasonality to the data we are looking at, and now we might change to Time Series approaches
If I’m predicting on Mar 30 2023 the outcomes for the next 3 months, the “random sample” in our train/test would have caused data leakage, overfitting, and poor model performance in production. We mustn’t take information about the future and apply it to the present when we are predicting in a model context.
These are two of, I think, the biggest points for why we are doing jan/feb/march. I wouldn’t do it any other way.
Train: Jan
Test: Feb
Validate: March
The point of validation is to report out model metrics to leadership, regulators, auditors, and record the models performance to then later analyze target drift

Run “docker run -it zoomcamp_test ls /app” output -> model.bin
This will list the contents of the app directory and “model.bin” should output. With this you could just copy your files, for example “copy myfile .” maybe a requirements file and this can be run for example “docker run -it myimage myscript arg1 arg2 ”. Of course keep in mind a build is needed everytime you change the Dockerfile.
Another variation is to have it run when you run the docker file.

mlops-zoomcamp,Module 6: Best practices,Generate Evidently Chart in Grafana,"Problem: Can we generate charts like Evidently inside Grafana?
Solution: In Grafana that would be a stat panel (just a number) and scatter plot panel (I believe it requires a plug-in). However, there is no native way to quickly recreate this exact Evidently dashboard. You'd need to make sure you have all the relevant information logged to your Grafana data source, and then design your own plots in Grafana.
If you want to recreate the Evidently visualizations externally, you can export the Evidently output in JSON with include_render=True
(more details here https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/customization/json-dict-output) and then parse information from it for your external visualization layer. To include everything you need for non-aggregated visuals, you should also add ""raw_data"": True  option (more details here https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/customization/report-data-aggregation).
Overall, this specific plot with under- and over-performance segments is more useful during debugging, so might be easier to access it ad hoc using Evidently.

mlops-zoomcamp,Module 6: Best practices,Get an error ‘ unspecified location constraint is incompatible ’,"You may get an error while creating a bucket with localstack and the boto3 client:
botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (IllegalLocationConstraintException) when calling the CreateBucket operation: The unspecified location constraint is incompatible for the region specific endpoint this request was sent to.
To fix this, instead of creating a bucket via
s3_client.create_bucket(Bucket='nyc-duration')
Create it with
s3_client.create_bucket(Bucket='nyc-duration', CreateBucketConfiguration={
'LocationConstraint': AWS_DEFAULT_REGION})

mlops-zoomcamp,Module 6: Best practices,Get an error “<botocore.awsrequest.AWSRequest object at 0x7fbaf2666280>” after running an AWS CLI command,"When executing an AWS CLI command (e.g., aws s3 ls), you can get the error <botocore.awsrequest.AWSRequest object at 0x7fbaf2666280>.
To fix it, simply set the AWS CLI environment variables:
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-1
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=foobar
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=foobar
Their value is not important; anything would be ok.
